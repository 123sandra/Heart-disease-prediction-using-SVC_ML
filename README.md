# Heart-disease-prediction-using-SVC_ML
Heart Disease prediction using Support Vector Classifier which is a classification methord using in Machine Learning.

    ->First i have ckecked if there are any null values in the dataset and also removed unwanted columns.
    
    ->Split the dataset into Features that is input and Target that is output using iloc() function.
    
    ->Then i scaled the dataset using Standard Scaler from Scikit-learn library.
    
    ->Split the dataset for training and testing using train_test_split.
    
    ->Imported SVC (Support vector classifier) from SVM (Support vector machine).
    
    ->Find the Accuracy and Classification report additionally i also generated the Confusion matrix.
    
    ->Inserted new values for prediction.
